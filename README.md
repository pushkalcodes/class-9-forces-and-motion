# Class 9 - Forces and Motion

Interactive physics course content covering Newton's laws of motion, forces, and fundamental physics concepts for Class 9 students.

## 🎯 Course Topics

- **Newton's First Law** - Understanding inertia and the law of motion
- **Balanced & Unbalanced Forces** - How forces affect object motion  
- **Newton's Second Law** - The relationship between force, mass, and acceleration (F = ma)
- **Mathematical Derivations** - Step-by-step physics equation derivations
- **Inertia and Mass** - Concepts of resistance to motion changes
- **Newton's Third Law** - Action-reaction pairs in physics
